`gig` is a command line tool to help you create useful `.gitignore` files for your project.
It is inspired by [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/) and make use of
the large collection of useful [`.gitignore` templates](https://github.com/toptal/gitignore) of the web service.
This also means that `gig` supports the are four file types that gitignore.io recognizes.
Content generated by `gig` should match the one generated by [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/) except the
order of stacks in which [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/) does not seem to guarantee any.

## Motivation

Prior to this project, I used to have one of [these command lines](https://docs.gitignore.io/install/command-line) in my `.zshrc`.
However, problems I have with this command line are that
- I won't be able to use it without internet access
- It seems [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/) that is not using the latest templates in https://github.com/toptal/gitignore. The project needs to update to the latest git submodule then deploy it.

Therefore this tool is created to solve the two main problems above.

# Install

## Binaries

The [release page contains](https://github.com/shihanng/gig/releases) binaries built
for various platforms. Download then extract the binary with `tar -xf`.
Place the binary in the `$PATH` e.g. `/usr/local/bin`.

## With `go get`

```
go get github.com/shihanng/gig
```

# Usage

Use the supported language as input arguments, e.g. `Go Elm`.

```
gig gen Go Elm

### Elm ###
# elm-package generated files
elm-stuff
# elm-repl generated files
repl-temp-*

### Go ###
# Binaries for programs and plugins
*.exe
*.exe~
*.dll
*.so
*.dylib

# Test binary, built with `go test -c`
*.test

# Output of the go coverage tool, specifically when used with LiteIDE
*.out

# Dependency directories (remove the comment below to include it)
# vendor/

### Go Patch ###
/vendor/
/Godeps/
```

At the very first run the program will clone the templates repository <https://github.com/toptal/gitignore.git>
into `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/gig`.
This means that internet connection is not required after the first successful run.

For more information:

```
gig --help
```

# Contributing

Found a bug or want to hack around? Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:shihanng/gig.git
```

When you are ready run the tests:

```
make test
make integ-test
make lint
```

Where `test` run the tests that can be run locally.
`integ-test` run the tests that require internet access.
`lint` help you write better Go codes.

If you are adding new subcommand, we are using [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
and managed the version with [tools.go](./tools.go) and [go.mod](./go.mod).
